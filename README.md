## Introduction

The [Oculus Integration] asset for the [Unity] software provides direct access to the Oculus hardware API and therefore offers a number of additional features outside of the default Unity software XR offering.

This SDK Wrapper enables the Oculus Integration features to be used with other Tilia packages for tighter integration.

> **Requires**:
> * The Unity software version `2018.3.10f1` (or above).
> * The Oculus Integration asset `1.43` (or above).
